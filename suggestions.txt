Suggestions to improve the Project Detail page layout (no changes to data model or behavior):

Improve information hierarchy
Place project title + status badge + last-updated + owner in a compact header (left) with primary actions (Run / Edit) on the right.
Use a breadcrumb above the header for context and quicker navigation.
Two-column responsive layout
Large left column (primary content): flow visualizer / canvas, main logs viewer, run details.
Right column (secondary, sticky on scroll): live activity / SSE feed, run history, quick metadata (env, webhook URL), and actions. Make it sticky on desktop for quick context.
KPI strip under the header
Show 3–5 compact KPI cards (Runs, Success %, Avg Duration, Last Run). Use small sparkline icons and concise numbers; hide sparklines on small screens.
Flow canvas / visual area
Make the flow viewer the dominant visual (wide container), allow zoom, fullscreen, and collapse to metadata view.
Add an accessible legend and a compact toolbar (zoom, center, fullscreen, copy link).
Tabs for detail sections
Use tabs under the flow area: Details | Logs | Events | Settings | History.
Default to Details or Logs based on last user action (persist via localStorage).
Live events feed improvements (SSE)
Show live connection indicator (green/yellow/red), "Auto-scroll" toggle, and "Pause live" button.
Group events by run and allow expanding a run to see full logs.
Virtualize long lists for performance.
Loading / skeleton / empty states
Add skeleton loaders for header, KPIs, canvas and right column while server data loads.
For empty flows show an illustration + CTA: "Add step" or "Import flow".
Responsiveness & collapse behaviors
On small screens collapse right column into a bottom drawer or accessible toggled panel.
Collapse KPI cards into a single row of chips on mobile.
Accessibility & keyboard
Ensure keyboard nav between tabs and flow nodes; add aria-labels for toolbar actions.
Provide focus-visible styles on interactive elements.
Micro-interactions & feedback
Small success animations for runs, inline toast for SSE connection errors, and optimistic UI for small actions.
Performance & maintainability
Virtualize large lists (react-virtual).
Memoize heavy components (flow viewer).
Keep layout as small presentational components (Header, KPIs, FlowCanvas, RightPanel, Tabs) so unit testing and styling are isolated.
Example responsive layout skeleton (proposed structure — paste into the page file or create components as you prefer):

Would you like a PR-style patch that adds these presentational components (Header, KPIs, FlowCanvas, RightPanel) into src/app/dashboard/projects/[id]/page.tsx, or would you prefer a smaller incremental change (e.g., only add the sticky right panel or the KPI strip)?
