ScreenFlow UI Style Guide

Target Audience:
- Creative professionals, researchers, designers, and visual thinkers.
- Users who collect, organize, and automate visual references from the web.
- People who appreciate a modern, playful, and inspiring interface—less “corporate SaaS,” more creative tool.

1. Modern, Playful, Creative, Futuristic

Typography:
- Headings: Use a bold, geometric sans-serif font (e.g., Sora, Space Grotesk, DM Sans, or Inter). Consider fonts with a bit of roundness or personality.
- Body: Clean sans-serif (Inter, Roboto, or similar) for readability.
- Slightly increased letter-spacing for headings to add a futuristic, airy feel.

Whitespace:
- Generous padding and margin in all components—let elements “breathe.”
- Use whitespace to create a sense of calm, focus, and visual hierarchy.

Shadows:
- Subtle, soft drop shadows on cards and modals.
- Avoid harsh or high-contrast shadows; use low-opacity, slightly spread shadows for gentle depth.

Corners:
- Slight rounding (6px or 8px), but avoid pill shapes or heavy rounding.
- Consider occasional use of organic or “blobby” shapes in backgrounds or section dividers for a creative touch.

Color:
- Neutral base: white and light gray backgrounds.
- Playful, creative accent colors: pastel blues, purples, mint, coral, or yellow.
- Use gradients for buttons, highlights, or section backgrounds—don’t be afraid to use lively, multi-color gradients for a creative vibe.
- Allow for “floating” or overlapping accent shapes in backgrounds.

Playfulness & Motion:
- Micro-interactions: button scaling, hover color shifts, bounce or wiggle on icons, animated icons (e.g., Loader2 spinning).
- Smooth fade/slide-in for cards and modals.
- Playful empty states and onboarding illustrations (abstract, geometric, or hand-drawn style).

Borders:
- Thin, subtle borders (1px, light gray) to separate sections.
- Avoid heavy outlines.

Component Consistency:
- All style changes should be at the component level (Card, Button, Input, etc.) for consistency and scalability.
- Use variants for different moods (e.g., Button with “playful” or “futuristic” variant).

2. Scalability & Modularity

- Use a component-driven approach: all UI should be built from shared components.
- If/when needed, define spacing, color, border-radius, and shadow tokens centrally (e.g., Tailwind config, CSS variables, or a theme file).
- Prefer updating components, not individual pages.

3. Icons & Graphics

- Use a consistent icon set with a modern, geometric, and friendly style (e.g., Phosphor, Tabler, Lucide).
- Prefer outlined or duotone icons for a clean, creative look.
- Use animated icons for loading states (e.g., Loader2 spinning).
- For playful touches, use simple, abstract, or hand-drawn illustrations for empty states, onboarding, or section dividers (see Open Peeps, Blush, or whimsical.com for inspiration).
- Avoid skeuomorphic or overly detailed graphics; keep icons and illustrations minimal, bold, and expressive.

4. Inspiration

- Notion: Playful minimalism, micro-interactions, and inviting empty states.
- Figma: Creative, collaborative energy, geometric shapes, and lively colors.
- Pitch: Bold gradients, expressive icons, and energetic transitions.
- Miro: Creative, collaborative, with sticky-note and hand-drawn motifs.
- Whimsical: Hand-drawn, playful, and approachable.
- Dropbox Paper: Clean, friendly, with subtle illustrations and soft colors.

Summary:
- Focus on updating core UI components to use more whitespace, subtle shadows, modest rounding, bold fonts, playful micro-interactions, and creative accents.
- Use a neutral base with lively, creative accent colors and gradients.
- Make all style changes at the component level for consistency and scalability.
- Use modern, geometric icons and minimal, abstract, or hand-drawn illustrations for a cohesive, creative look.

How to adapt Stripe Press style for SaaS:

1. Typography:

Use bold, expressive headings and clear, readable body text.
Editorial layouts often use larger font sizes and more dramatic hierarchy—this can make dashboards and forms feel more “designed” and less utilitarian.
2. Whitespace & Layout:

Maintain generous whitespace, but structure it around functional UI (cards, forms, navigation).
Use editorial-style section dividers, but keep the grid and alignment tight for usability.
3. Color & Gradients:

Stripe Press uses gradients and bold accent colors for backgrounds, highlights, and illustrations.
For SaaS, use gradients in hero sections, CTAs, or as subtle backgrounds behind cards—don’t overdo it, but let them add energy.
4. Graphics & Illustration:

Use abstract, geometric, or playful illustrations for empty states, onboarding, or to highlight features.
Stripe Press’s illustrations are minimal but expressive—this works well for SaaS, especially for visual reference/automation tools.
5. Playful Touches:

Editorial sites often have delightful micro-interactions (hover effects, animated icons, transitions). These can make forms, buttons, and navigation feel lively and engaging.
6. Componentization:

The editorial style can be modularized: cards, sections, feature highlights, etc.
Build these as reusable components, so the style is consistent and scalable across the app.
7. Navigation & Usability:

Keep navigation clear and accessible—editorial style can sometimes hide nav, but for SaaS, clarity is key.
Use bold, clear nav bars, but style them with the same editorial flair (typography, color, subtle shadow).
Summary:
Stripe Press’s style can absolutely be adapted for SaaS:

Use its bold typography, whitespace, gradients, and illustration style,
But apply them to functional components (cards, forms, nav, dashboards)
Keep usability and clarity at the forefront, but let the visual style inspire creativity and delight.
